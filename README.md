# Trello-like Board

Tried to recreate a trello-like board (aka Kanban board) that would have all CRUD elements and be draggable.

Was able to finish most functionality but everything got messed up once I added the [drag & drop API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTML_Drag_and_Drop_API).

So I have some **bugs** :bug: :unamused:

### Things I need to fix:
- **MY MOST URGENT PROBLEM**: I need to be able to *edit* and *delete* items once they have been moved to another column since currently the functionality only works when the items are on the first column and have not been dragged yet
- I've gotten local storage to work for the Todo's, but not for the background changer I have on the upper right hand corner. I'd like to set that up as well.
- ~~Just a pesky aesthetic flaw where I can't seem to make the edit and delete buttons stay on the right-hand side of the element :triumph:~~ Well managed to get this one resolved 3/6/24

So yes, I'm aware it is not perfect and needs some major work. K thanks.
